# Picross NP patches

A collection of game patches for Picross NP series (SNES).

## Overview

### Improved cursor

This patch attempts to fix the slippery-feeling cursor, and increasing its speed when in turbo mode for faster navigation.

### No time limit

This patch removes the in-game time limit and mistake penalties. Essentially, chapters 1-4 are modified to use the stopwatch mode from chapters 5/6, allowing the games to be played in a style closer to modern Picross with no assits.

## How to use

- Use any rom patcher that accepts IPS format, for example [RomPatcher.js](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/)
- Always confirm checksum of the source rom
- Patches can be applied in any order
